# Learning Language Modeling: Part 1.0
## A Journey with Andrej Karpathy's 'makemore'

In this notebook, we embark on a journey inspired by Andrej Karpathy's "Building makemore" [Part 1](https://youtu.be/PaCmpygFfXo?si=5zoeB0XGpTIEgOGK) (this notebook specifically focuses on the first half of the video). Our goal is to understand how simple models can learn to predict the next character in a text sequence. This notebook follows Karpathy's experimentation, offering a step-by-step exploration rather than a streamlined final product.
